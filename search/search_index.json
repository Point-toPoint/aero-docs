The title speaks for itself - in this section I will be answering the questions below. Aero doesn't respond to my messages, why? There are a few answers. Please make sure that: Aero has \"send messages\", \"view channel\" and \"embed links\" permissions. You are not sending commands in a DM. Send commands in a server channel. Not rate limited (on cooldown). The bot has an anti-spam system implemented, which does not allow you to run commands in a short time period. The server does not have an outage. If all of the above don't work for you, try asking someone to run ;ping . If Aero responds to them: Your Internet connection might be slow / unavailable. You have been rate limited (not Aero's one, Discord rate limit) You have been blocked from using Aero: If that's the case, you can submit an appeal in our Discord server . How to add Aero to my server? You cannot add Aero to your own server (yet?). Where can I post a bug / suggestion? In this website's GitHub repository.
